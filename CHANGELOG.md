# Changelog

All notable changes to LEADOS are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project
uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

**Honesty note (Part 19):** this changelog was curated retroactively. The repository snapshot
used to write it contains no prior git history, no prior tags, and none of the stale status
reports referenced by earlier planning documents (`APP-STATUS-REPORT.txt`,
`APP-CAPABILITY-REPORT.md`, etc.) — see `docs/CONSISTENCY-SWEEP.md` for the full accounting. This
file therefore starts at the first version that can be verified against real code:
**v0.1.0**. No entries describe work that cannot be pointed at a file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Canonical zero-build leadership workspace with roster, 1:1s, SBI feedback, goals, GROW,
  anonymous pulse, decisions, recognition, succession, health and traceable signals.
- Evidence-linked performance-review packets with employee reflection, manager assessment,
  optional anchored ratings, calibration warnings, source drill-down and print/save-PDF.
- Schema v2 migration, review export/import, frozen completion snapshots and audit events.
- 96 canonical domain, persistence and jsdom UI integration tests (`npm test`).

### Fixed
- Key-result dialogs now write to the goal that opened them and missing goals fail explicitly.
- Development-plan editing preserves plan identity, options and commitments.
- Development overdue counts use the injected clock for deterministic results.

### Security
- Anonymous pulse answers and upward feedback about the manager are excluded from review
  evidence. Review source routes are normalized to local fragments on import.
- Legacy Next.js/PostCSS/Sharp advisories remain documented; the canonical app does not load
  that dependency chain and no forced major legacy upgrade was applied.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-01

First documented, verifiable release.

### Added
- `leads` and `score_events` tables (`src/db/schema.ts`).
- Rule-based lead scoring, `rule-v1` (`src/lib/scoring.ts`): additive, fully explainable, no ML.
- Lead API: create/list/filter (`src/app/api/leads/route.ts`), get/update/delete by id
  (`src/app/api/leads/[id]/route.ts`), force rescoring (`src/app/api/leads/[id]/score/route.ts`).
- Dashboard at `/` to add leads, view scores with breakdown tooltip, and record a
  qualify/disqualify/contacted/converted decision (`src/app/page.tsx`,
  `src/components/LeadBoard.tsx`).
- Health check endpoint reporting DB connectivity and app version
  (`src/app/api/health/route.ts`).
- Seed script with four sample leads for onboarding (`scripts/seed.ts`, `npm run seed`).
- Full Diátaxis documentation set under `docs/` (tutorial, how-to guides, reference, explanation),
  tied together by `docs/INDEX.md`.
- Release engineering: `docs/RELEASING.md`, `docs/ROLLBACK.md`,
  `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- Deployment: single canonical Docker path, `Dockerfile`, `deploy-production.sh`,
  `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- Governance: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `docs/adr/` with ADR-0001 and ADR-0002,
  `docs/MAINTAINER-RUNBOOK.md`.
- Dependency-free docs link checker (`scripts/check-docs-links.mjs`), wired into
  `npm run verify` and CI.

### Changed
- Renamed the project from the scaffold name "Arena Next.js PostgreSQL Starter" to **LEADOS**
  across `package.json`, `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx`, and an internal global variable
  in `src/db/index.ts`. See `docs/CONSISTENCY-SWEEP.md` item C-1.
- `/api/health` now also reports `service` and `version` fields, not just `ok`.

### Known gaps (tracked, not hidden)
- No authentication/authorization anywhere in the app.
- No multi-tenancy; single shared table for all leads.
- No automated tests, coverage, or mutation-testing reports.
- No realtime transport; the dashboard only refetches after actions it took itself.
- No fairness-auditing tooling, because there is no learned model to audit.
