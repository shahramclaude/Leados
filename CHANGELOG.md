# Changelog

All notable changes to LEADOS are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project
uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

**Honesty note (Part 19):** this changelog was curated retroactively. The repository snapshot
used to write it contains no prior git history, no prior tags, and none of the stale status
reports referenced by earlier planning documents (`APP-STATUS-REPORT.txt`,
`APP-CAPABILITY-REPORT.md`, etc.) — see `docs/CONSISTENCY-SWEEP.md` for the full accounting. This
file therefore starts at the first version that can be verified against real code:
**v0.1.0**. No entries describe work that cannot be pointed at a file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Development-commitment ledger (Schema v9).** A GROW "will" action is no longer a checkbox with a
  date. Each commitment can be closed in a review, **carried forward** with a new date (the original
  stays as history and the successor keeps the first-agreed date, so "carried 2× since 14 Sep" is
  derived from the chain rather than stored), or **dropped with a mandatory reason**. Dropped is never
  counted as done and leaves the completion denominator, so moving a date cannot read as progress.
  A corrupted chain — orphaned successor, missing back-reference, cycle — is repaired by reopening the
  promise with a warning instead of losing it.
- **Development reviews as records, not edits.** *Hold review* captures the date, what was actually
  discussed, the outcome for every live commitment (done / still open / carried / dropped) and the next
  date agreed. Pushing `reviewOn` without holding a review increments `reviewDeferrals` and stamps
  `reviewMovedOn` instead of silently rescheduling; holding one resets both and sets the plan date to
  the agreed next review.
- **Two new signals.** `GROW-06` fires when one commitment has been carried two or more times (the GROW
  equivalent of `CONV-06`), and `GROW-07` fires when a review date has been moved twice without a review
  being held. Both name the person, carry the dates as evidence and one action.
- **Follow-through surfaces.** `#/growth` gains live commitments with carry badges, overdue dates,
  per-commitment **Carry** / **Drop** buttons, an expandable record of closed and moved commitments, a
  review log with what each review settled, and **Hold review**; person pages show carried work and where
  the review stands; Today's loose ends name the person whose review is overdue and flag commitments
  carried twice. The `actions` CSV adds `state`, `carried_forward_count` and `first_agreed_on` to GROW
  rows, and the `growthPlans` scope adds `will_open`, `will_carried`, `will_dropped`, `reviews_held`,
  `last_reviewed_on` and `review_deferrals`.
- **Dated snapshots rewind the development ledger too.** A commitment completed, dropped or carried
  after a snapshot date is shown as it was at that date, a successor agreed later is withheld, and a
  review recorded later is excluded with `reviewOn` left `null` and the growth dimension marked
  `approximate` rather than reconstructed.
- **Demo.** Mei's plan now exercises every state: one commitment carried twice and still open, one
  carried once and late, one closed in a review, one dropped with a reason, and a review date moved
  twice since the last review was held.

- **Commitment ownership (Schema v8).** Every 1:1 action now records who owes it — `them`,
  `leader` or `shared` — or stays explicitly unrecorded, which the board counts rather than
  guessing. A promise carried into a later 1:1 keeps its owner; reassigning one is a separate,
  audited action (`oneonone.action.owner`) that refuses closed promises and already-carried
  originals. The actions CSV carries a truthful `owner` column (blank when unrecorded, absent for
  GROW commitments) and the printable prep sheet marks who owes each promise.
- **A private "What you owe" list.** Today gains a card listing the leader's own open promises with
  a one-click Done and a 1:1 shortcut; the 1:1 board gains an "I owe" stat and an inline owner
  select (accented when the promise is the leader's). Signal `CONV-07` fires per person when the
  leader is late on a promise they own, at severity 3 — or 4 when one person is waiting on more
  than one.
- **1:1 follow-through ledger (Schema v7).** Logging a 1:1 now opens with the previous meeting's
  open promises and records an explicit outcome for each: done in this conversation, still open,
  carried forward with a new date, or dropped with a reason. The original action keeps a link to
  its successor, carry depth and "first agreed" are derived from the chain, and a broken, backward
  or cyclic link reopens the promise with a warning instead of losing it. Visible in the 1:1
  dialog, the 1:1 board (`#/oneonones` — follow-through stats, "Up next", "Commitments that keep
  moving", carried badges and a per-meeting ledger), the person page, the printable prep sheet and
  the `actions` / `oneOnOnes` CSV exports. Adds signal `CONV-06` (a promise carried at least twice)
  and a "N promises closed in a 1:1" win.
- Canonical zero-build leadership workspace with roster, 1:1s, SBI feedback, goals, GROW,
  anonymous pulse, decisions, recognition, succession, health and traceable signals.
- Feedback observation dates, configurable observation-to-conversation latency, `FB-06`, and
  date correction that leaves missing values explicitly unmeasured.
- Tri-state goal co-authorship with editable co-authored/leader-set/unknown context and explicit `GOAL-06`.
- Outcome delegation with decision authority, support, due dates, dated check-ins, completion,
  return-to-leader history, `DEL-01`…`DEL-03`, 1:1 agenda integration and a dedicated route.
- Evidence-linked performance-review packets with employee reflection, manager assessment,
  optional anchored ratings, calibration warnings, source drill-down and print/save-PDF.
  Packets now include feedback latency, goal authorship and dated delegation outcomes.
- Schema v2/v3 migrations, review/delegation export/import, frozen completion snapshots and audit events.
- 113 canonical domain, persistence and jsdom UI integration tests (`npm test`).

### Changed
- `CONV-05` now reports only commitments the team owes. Overdue promises the leader owns are
  reported by `CONV-07`, so one overdue record no longer produces two findings.
- CSV exports no longer carry a fabricated `owner` column for GROW, feedback and onboarding
  commitments: the app never recorded an owner there. The
  one-on-ones export reports `carried_in` / `carried_out` instead of the ambiguous
  `carried_forward`, and the actions export adds `state`, `carried_forward_count`,
  `first_agreed_on` and `confirmed_in_meeting`.
- Historical health snapshots rewind completions, drops and carry links together, so a trend can
  no longer show a promise as closed before the meeting that closed it.

### Fixed
- Key-result dialogs now write to the goal that opened them and missing goals fail explicitly.
- Development-plan editing preserves plan identity, options and commitments.
- Development overdue counts use the injected clock for deterministic results.
- Goal authorship editing preserves goal identity, key results and check-ins; missing goals fail explicitly.
- Delegation chronology is validated before writes, and later same-day check-ins correctly supersede
  an earlier blocked state without erasing the overdue fact.
- Demo cleanup removes delegations attached to fabricated people while preserving real-person work.
- The 1:1 board's promise table had an unlabelled action column (axe `empty-table-header`); it is
  now labelled "Actions".
- A hand-edited or future-version `owner` value is cleared and reported
  (`1:1s: cleared N unrecognised commitment owner(s)`) instead of being coerced into a plausible
  owner.

### Security
- Anonymous pulse answers and upward feedback about the manager are excluded from review
  evidence. Review source routes are normalized to local fragments on import.
- Legacy Next.js/PostCSS/Sharp advisories remain documented; the canonical app does not load
  that dependency chain and no forced major legacy upgrade was applied.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-01

First documented, verifiable release.

### Added
- `leads` and `score_events` tables (`src/db/schema.ts`).
- Rule-based lead scoring, `rule-v1` (`src/lib/scoring.ts`): additive, fully explainable, no ML.
- Lead API: create/list/filter (`src/app/api/leads/route.ts`), get/update/delete by id
  (`src/app/api/leads/[id]/route.ts`), force rescoring (`src/app/api/leads/[id]/score/route.ts`).
- Dashboard at `/` to add leads, view scores with breakdown tooltip, and record a
  qualify/disqualify/contacted/converted decision (`src/app/page.tsx`,
  `src/components/LeadBoard.tsx`).
- Health check endpoint reporting DB connectivity and app version
  (`src/app/api/health/route.ts`).
- Seed script with four sample leads for onboarding (`scripts/seed.ts`, `npm run seed`).
- Full Diátaxis documentation set under `docs/` (tutorial, how-to guides, reference, explanation),
  tied together by `docs/INDEX.md`.
- Release engineering: `docs/RELEASING.md`, `docs/ROLLBACK.md`,
  `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- Deployment: single canonical Docker path, `Dockerfile`, `deploy-production.sh`,
  `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- Governance: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `docs/adr/` with ADR-0001 and ADR-0002,
  `docs/MAINTAINER-RUNBOOK.md`.
- Dependency-free docs link checker (`scripts/check-docs-links.mjs`), wired into
  `npm run verify` and CI.

### Changed
- Renamed the project from the scaffold name "Arena Next.js PostgreSQL Starter" to **LEADOS**
  across `package.json`, `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx`, and an internal global variable
  in `src/db/index.ts`. See `docs/CONSISTENCY-SWEEP.md` item C-1.
- `/api/health` now also reports `service` and `version` fields, not just `ok`.

### Known gaps (tracked, not hidden)
- No authentication/authorization anywhere in the app.
- No multi-tenancy; single shared table for all leads.
- No automated tests, coverage, or mutation-testing reports.
- No realtime transport; the dashboard only refetches after actions it took itself.
- No fairness-auditing tooling, because there is no learned model to audit.
