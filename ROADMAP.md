# ROADMAP

Living document. Status is per capability, not per file. Every "Done" line was verified
by an automated test or a measured run in the session that claimed it; anything else is
marked `[UNVERIFIED]` and is not counted as done.

Last updated: 2026-10-24 (session 8: printable 1:1 prep sheet shipped — `#/prep/<personId>` combines the person's own topics, the generated agenda with reasons, every open commitment grouped by source, what happened since you last spoke and outcomes at risk, with confidential conflict records and anonymous pulse answers excluded by construction; new `person.talkingPoints` field; `tests/app/prep.test.mjs` covers assembly, ordering, the privacy invariant, persistence and axe-core; 214 automated tests).

| Schema v2 review, v3 latency/authorship/delegation, v4 conflict and v5 dated-snapshot migrations, with dynamic demo protection/cleanup | `core/schema.js`, `core/store.js`, `actions.js` | additive v1→v2→v3→v4→v5 migration, null preservation for pre-v5 records, reload/import and real/demo preservation tests |
| Key-result dialog targets its source goal; development-plan edit preserves the plan | `ui/modals.js`, `actions.js` | UI regression tests for both flows |
| Development overdue calculations use the injected clock | `domain/growth.js` and callers | regression test with 2019 and 2026 clocks |
| Accessibility: skip link, dialog keyboard/focus behaviour, live errors, visible disabled controls, non-color chart stroke/shape coding and HTML data tables | `ui/dom.js`, `ui/charts.js`, `ui/conflict-modals.js`, `styles.css` | jsdom keyboard + `axe-core` tests on `#/health` and `#/settings` (0 semantic/ARIA/table violations); Session 4 Chromium + axe baseline; Session 5 real-Chromium pixel contrast `[UNVERIFIED]` |
| Dialogs cannot survive a route change | `app/main.js` | integration test |
| Roster search that does not steal focus | `views/people.js` | integration test |
| Conflict listening → explicit agreement → owned results → verified follow-up → resolution, with support handoff/reopening/version history | `domain/conflicts.js`, `conflict-actions.js`, `ui/conflict-modals.js`, `views/conflicts.js` | 29 conflict tests |
| Conflict content isolated from health/talent/reviews/agendas/person timelines/routine CSVs; general reminders are counts only, including roster-free workspaces | `domain/insights.js`, `views/today.js`, `core/csv.js` | privacy regression assertions across views, timelines and all routine CSV scopes |
| Unsupported/future schemas refused on import and protected on load, original export preserved even after failed replacement; CSV export refused when `writeBlockReason` active | `core/store.js`, `actions.js`, `core/csv.js` | 5 storage-safety tests + CSV future-schema/QuotaExceeded tests |

| Longitudinal trends across all 5 health dimensions, composite health, feedback latency and delegation follow-through (8w / 12w / 6m) with survivorship-bias fix, matched-dimension deltas and `exact`/`approximate` disclosures | `domain/health.js`, `domain/trends.js`, `ui/charts.js`, `views/health.js`, `views/today.js` | `tests/app/trends.test.mjs` (survivorship bias, Simpson's/coverage-shift guard, pre-history null guard, UI switching, `axe-core`) |
| Scoped, unknown-preserving, OWASP CWE-1236 formula-safe CSV exports across 13 tables with pulse anonymity/comment floors and confidential conflict confirmation | `core/csv.js`, `core/store.js`, `views/settings.js` | `tests/app/csv.test.mjs` (12 formula vectors incl. full-width Unicode & whitespace, negative numbers, RFC 4180 round-trip, pulse suppression, QuotaExceeded, `axe-core`) |
| Optional passphrase encryption of the browser copy: 600k-round PBKDF2 derivation, AES-256-GCM envelope with AAD-bound KDF parameters, verified plaintext→encrypted migration, lock/unlock/change passphrase/disable | `core/crypto.js`, `core/store.js`, `views/vault.js`, `ui/vault-dialogs.js` | `tests/app/encryption.test.mjs` (20 tests: no plaintext in storage, wrong-passphrase refusal, tamper/AAD, iteration-floor DoS guard, quota-failure rollback, no-crypto detection) |
| A locked workspace cannot be written to, quarantined, exported empty or reset accidentally | `core/store.js`, `views/vault.js` | encryption tests (all write paths, ciphertext byte-identity, export returns the untouched file, typed DELETE required to erase) |
| Encrypted backups and import in both directions, with the storage mode disclosed | `core/store.js`, `views/settings.js`, `ui/vault-dialogs.js` | encryption tests (restore into plain/locked/unlocked states, wrong passphrase changes nothing, downgrade message asserted) |
| Lock screen is the only thing rendered while locked, keyboard-usable and axe-clean | `views/vault.js`, `main.js`, `styles.css` | jsdom tests (no records leaked into the screen, error live region, show-passphrase toggle, `axe-core` 0 violations) |
| A stored backup envelope is refused rather than normalised into an empty workspace | `core/store.js`, `views/vault.js` | encryption tests (refused unlock, untouched file, working restore path) |
| Idle auto-lock: warn, then lock an unlocked encrypted workspace after inactivity, with a non-destructive "keep working" warning and a one-minute grace; the lock is logged to the event log | `app/core/idle.js`, `app/main.js`, `app/core/schema.js`, `app/actions.js`, `app/ui/modals.js` | `tests/app/idle.test.mjs` (activity reset, warn → lock transitions, tab restored from background) |
| Printable 1:1 prep sheet: employee topics, generated agenda with reasons, grouped open commitments (1:1 actions, feedback follow-ups, development actions, delegation checkpoints), what happened since you last spoke, outcomes at risk and a notes area; confidential conflict records and anonymous pulse answers excluded by construction | `app/core/domain/prep.js`, `app/views/prep.js`, `app/main.js`, `app/views/person.js`, `app/ui/modals.js`, `app/core/schema.js`, `app/actions.js`, `app/core/demo.js` | `tests/app/prep.test.mjs` (assembly, overdue ordering, privacy regression, persistence/repair, route render, print flow, axe-core) |
| 1:1 action follow-through lifecycle & promise reconciliation: action status (`open`, `completed`, `dropped`), drop reasons, inline prior-commitment reconciliation in 1:1 logging dialog, follow-through analytics (promise integrity rate, on-time rate, latency), filtered board tabs, person view follow-through card, and enriched CSV export | `app/core/domain/oneonone.js`, `app/core/schema.js`, `app/actions.js`, `app/ui/modals.js`, `app/views/oneonones.js`, `app/views/person.js`, `app/core/csv.js`, `app/styles.css` | `tests/app/followthrough.test.mjs` (lifecycle normalization, prior-meeting reconciliation, stats calculation with non-fabrication nulls, agenda suggestion, CSV export) |
| 220 automated tests | `tests/app/**` | `npm test` — 220 pass / 0 fail / 0 skipped |

Baseline measured on the demo workspace (`2026-10-24T10:00:00Z`): health **54.5 (D)**,
30-day matched trend **+7.7** (`previous: 46.8`, `fidelity: exact`, reflecting dated check-in
KR snapshots rather than carrying current KR progress backward), pulse **n=5**, overall
**2.55/5**, safety **2.8**, workload **2.0**; **32 findings, 10 urgent, 2 wins**. Feedback
latency: **4 measured, 3.0d average, 1 beyond convention**; goals: **3 co-authored, 2
explicitly leader-set**; delegations: **2 active, 1 blocked/overdue, 1 check-in due, 1
completed, 1 returned**. No conflict cases are fabricated in the demo. The stricter comment
policy releases **0 comments**. All 15 main routes render without errors in JSDOM.

## Next (ordered by value, not by ease)

1. **Onboarding 30-60-90 milestone tracker.** Turn the existing first-90-day tenure signal
   (`ONB-01`) into explicit role-clarity, buddy/stakeholder introduction and early-win
   checkpoints for new joiners without inventing personality or performance grades.
2. **Team cognitive load & focus fragmentation analysis.** Measure multi-project goal context-switching, overdue delegation piles, and meeting cadence density to detect burnout risks before pulse scores drop.

*(1:1 action follow-through reconciliation, idle auto-lock, and the printable 1:1 prep sheet shipped: see the Done table above.)*

## Later / deliberately deferred

| Item | Why deferred |
|---|---|
| Legacy dependency remediation | Fresh production audit has 1 critical / 2 high findings in Next/PostCSS/Sharp. Not imported by the static app; upgrade and validate before any legacy deployment, rather than treating canonical tests as clearance. |
| Large-workspace performance, cross-browser/assistive-technology and print verification | Current browser evidence covers Chromium and selected desktop/mobile states; these broader behaviours remain [UNVERIFIED]. |
| Multi-user, org hierarchy, shared workspaces | Requires a backend, accounts and an honest privacy story. The current invariant is "no network, no server", and breaking it needs an ADR, not a sprint. |
| Upward / 360° feedback | Needs multiple raters to mean anything (see `RESEARCH.md` §10). |
| Notifications, email or calendar sync | A browser tab cannot schedule work; promising reminders it cannot deliver would be a silent failure. |
| Mobile app | The responsive web app is the mobile app until there is a reason otherwise. |
| AI/LLM assistance for drafting feedback | Needs network calls and would put unreviewed text in front of a person's record; the SBI coach is deterministic and auditable. Revisit only with a local model and a clear provenance marker. |
| Sentiment analysis of pulse comments | Unverifiable inference; violates the no-fabrication invariant. |
| Gamification (streaks, badges) | Rewards logging rather than leading; the scores already carry the incentive risk. |

---

## Rejected, with the reason recorded

| Idea | Reason |
|---|---|
| Repairing the legacy React/Next trees into the product | They are non-canonical and were not executed in the latest session; current runtime claims apply only to the zero-build app. Replacing the canonical architecture would require a fresh audit and ADR, not an assumed repair path. |
| Promoting several competing entry points | One canonical entry and test suite avoid contradictory product claims. Historical trees stay as evidence, not additional supported products. |
| Soft-deleting demo data silently | Replacing a leader's real records with fabricated ones is the worst possible failure mode; the store refuses without explicit confirmation. |
| Showing a pulse average under the anonymity floor | Makes individual answers recoverable by subtraction. Suppression is shown as a state, with the count, so it never looks like a broken chart. |
| Scoring missing data as zero | Turns "no evidence yet" into "failing". Unmeasurable dimensions are excluded and the weights renormalise. |
| Inferring missing observation dates or goal authorship | An unknown observation date is not instant feedback, and unknown authorship is not proof the leader set the goal. Both remain explicitly unknown until recorded. |
| A universal seven-day latency or check-in “best practice” score | The research supports timeliness and follow-through, not one validated cutoff for every team. Seven days is a configurable convention, shown as such. |
| A hard validation block on vague feedback | People stop logging. The app coaches instead, and keeps the note. |
| Trend lines with a single data point | Implies knowledge that does not exist; the UI says "not enough history" instead. |
| Self-assessment quizzes (leadership style, personality) | Not falsifiable against records, and they invite the leader to substitute a label for observation. |
| A numeric "leadership score" for the leader | Would turn a diagnostic tool into a grade, and the grade would be gamed. Team health is measured; the leader is shown their behaviour, not a mark. |

## Known gaps I am not pretending are closed

- Pulse anonymity and independent respondents cannot be guaranteed by a local single-manager workspace. Partial/unanimous/thin-comment windows now suppress more conservatively; that intentional loss of visible data is a safety tradeoff, not a chart regression.
- Conflict confirmations are manager-entered, not employee signatures or independent testimony. Handoff sends nothing. The browser copy can now be encrypted, but CSV and plain-text JSON exports stay unencrypted by design, so a downloaded backup is as protected as its folder. No real-manager conflict-practice validation has been performed.
- Historical health checkpoints are `exact` when backed by dated records and Schema v5
  snapshots, and explicitly labelled `approximate` when pre-v5 or in-place stage edits lack
  dated history. Fresh workspaces continue to show `pre-history` / "not enough history" rather
  than inventing past scores. Real-Chromium pixel/mobile verification of the new Session 5
  trend and CSV surfaces remains `[UNVERIFIED]` in a live browser binary until run outside
  this container.
- "Weekly meaningful feedback" is the evidence-backed cadence; the default feedback target is
  21 days because it is achievable. The 7-day latency and delegation-check-in values are
  configurable team conventions, not validated universal cutoffs.
- Review packets cannot recover history that was never logged. Current goal/development
  values and delegation status/authority are explicitly capture-time; there is no employee
  account or direct submission workflow, and calibration heuristics are not a validated
  fairness instrument.
- Encryption protects the stored browser copy and encrypted backups only. It does not protect an
  unlocked tab during active use, cannot recover a forgotten passphrase, and needs a secure
  context (https or localhost). An unlocked tab now auto-locks after a configurable inactivity
  window (default 30 minutes) with a warning first; see the Done table. Real-browser WebCrypto
  behaviour is `[UNVERIFIED]` here:
  Node's `webcrypto` was injected into jsdom.
- Rehearsal against real usage is absent: every number in this file comes from the demo
  workspace and the test suite, not from a manager's actual quarter. Real-browser visual
  inspection of print output remains `[UNVERIFIED]`; delegation mobile overflow/filter checks now run in Chromium, but exhaustive visual/interaction review remains `[UNVERIFIED]`. Source links and workflows are covered in jsdom, with HTTP module loading checked separately.
